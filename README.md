### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm Ruxin Qu.

I'm a Web Developer with one year of coding experience and four years of Linux/Unix experience. Recently, I graduated from the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Washington. I hold an M.S degree in computational chemistry.

I have a super cute golden retriever who often reminds me not to stay in front of the computer for too long and to go play!
