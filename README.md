### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm Ruxin Qu.

I'm a web developer passionate about writing clean and maintainable code. Recently, I graduated from the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Washington. I have an M.S degree in Computational Chemistry and a B.S in Material Chemistry.

I have a super cute golden retriever who often reminds me not to stay in front of the computer for too long and to go play!
